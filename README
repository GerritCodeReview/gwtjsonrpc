JSON-RPC for Google Web Toolkit (GWT)
-------------------------------------

The implementation is as close to the JSON-RPC 1.1 working draft[1]
as possible, while retaining a simple code base in both the GWT
client and the Java based server.

To use this module, build lib/gwtjsonrpc.jar (type "make"), place
the JAR into your classpath and inherit the module in your gwt.xml:

  <inherits name='com.google.gwtjsonrpc.GWTJSONRPC'/>

Java based JSON services should extend JsonServlet and directly
implement the service interface.  You will also need to include
lib/gson.jar and lib/commons-codec.jar in the server's CLASSPATH.

[1] http://json-rpc.org/wd/JSON-RPC-1-1-WD-20060807.html

Services may be implemented in any language that supports JSON-RPC
1.1, including Python, PHP, Perl, etc.  This package includes an
example Java based server to make development easier in a pure
Java application.


Differences from JSON-RPC 1.1
-----------------------------

Only positional parameters are supported.  Within a request the
'params' member must be missing, or must be a JSON array of the
positional parameters.

Only Java-style method names are supported.  A method name must
conform to ^[a-zA-Z_$][a-zA-Z_$0-9]*$ and thus any of the standard
"system.*" methods (e.g. "system.describe") is not supported.

Call approximation is not supported.  The 'params' member must
*exactly* match the declared parameters of the method being called.

Error codes sent by the Java server are always 999 as the JSON RPC
specification does not call out specific errors.

GET requests must specify the method name in the 'method' request
parameter, and the method parameters in 'param0' .. 'paramN'.

The request property "xrfKey" must be populated by a value obtained
from a prior response property, also named "xsrfKey".  The key is
optional in a response; if it is not present then the client should
assume the xsrfKey supplied in the request is still valid.  To get
an initial xsrfKey issue a request, obtain the value, and send the
same request again, but with the xsrfKey included.  The xsrfKey is
not supported on GET requests.

An optional 'callback' parameter in either the GET request parameters
or the POSTed JSON request block can be used to obtain a JSON-in-script
style response, facilitating the creation of "mash-ups".  The callback
function will be invoked with the 'result' instance, or null if there
was an error.  No error details are supplied. 


Differences from GWT-RPC
------------------------

This package uses the standard JSON-RPC 1.1 for wire encoding,
rather than a custom object serialization standard.

Benefits:

- Clients are not tied to GWT:

  Clients may be written in any language that has a JSON parser
  library available.  Objects are proper JSON objects with field
  names as declared in the Java classes being serialized.

- Servers are not tied to GWT:

  Servers may be written in any language, as the only requirement
  is that the server can create a properly formatted JSON string
  with the expected field names.  If the Java field names are easily
  recognized by a "subject matter expert" (or are at least documented
  in the Java class definition) it is easy to implement a server.

- Automatic XSRF (cross-site request forgery) protection:

  When using the Java based server implementation in this package
  automatic XSRF protection is enabled for every RPC.

- Only one interface must be declared:

  The Java server implementation implements the "async" variant of the
  service interface and calls the AsyncCallback to provide its response.
  This permits the Java server to (in some cases) also be compiled into
  the client to directly implement the interface, such as for an offline
  Google Gears/HTML 5 mode.

- Automatic JSON callback support:

  Managing JSON callbacks, including conversion to Java objects, is easier. 

Drawbacks:

- Object field names are exposed verbatim on the wire:

  GWT-RPC protects the field names by not including them in the
  JSON output.  If you are using GWT to obfuscate your JavaScript
  and hide intellectual property, this package isn't for you.

- Slightly larger object transfers:

  GWT-RPC recognizes fields by the position they appear in the JSON
  parse tree (the entire stream is encoded as one giant JSON array).
  This package includes field names in every object instance, as that
  is required by the JSON format.  The resulting string to be sent in
  either direction is larger.  This increase in size may be negated
  by the automatic "gzip" encoding, if the browser supports it.

- Exceptions are not "thrown" to the client:

  GWT-RPC supports declared exceptions using two interfaces; this
  package sends only the exception message back to the client
  and does not support throwing checked exceptions from service
  implementation methods.

- Method overloading is not supported:

  Only one method of each name can be declared in the interface.
  Thus "void foo(int a)" and "void foo(String a)" cannot be used.
  A simple (but annoying) work around is to add a unique suffix to
  each method name.


Other Features
--------------

- Separate servlet vs. service implementation classes:

  The service implementation can be implemented in a plain old Java
  object, and be constructed in a JsonServlet's createServiceHandle()
  method override.

  This strategy permits the service implementation to be complied as part of
  the GWT client side code for an offline mode.  As the service implementation
  implements the async interface directly an instance can be used anywhere the
  async interface is used.

- Selectable unique user string:

  The string used to tie the XSRF token to a specific user can be set
  by overriding JsonServlet's createActiveCall(), returning a custom
  subclass of the ActiveCall object.  Within the ActiveCall subclass
  override getUser().

  This strategy was used because if you need to supply a custom user
  string you probably need that (and more) data in your own service
  implementations.  Extending ActiveCall permits caching data into a
  per-request instance, speeding up multiple lookups.

- Configurable token encryption key, timeout:

  The token encryption key and/or timeout can be changed by overriding
  JsonServlet's createXsrfSignedToken() method.

- XSRF protection disabled on a per-method basis:

  Methods which do not require XSRF protection (for example read-only methods
  exposing public information) can be marked @AllowCrossSiteRequest to disable
  the automatic XSRF protection check code path in JsonServlet.

- RpcStatusListener to show "Loading ..." widgets:

  Applications can implement RpcStatusListener and register it to get updates
  during all RPC events.  This can be useful to automatically show/hide some
  sort of "Loading ..." or "Busy ..." widget when an RPC is taking place.  UI
  is left to the application.

- JSON callbacks:

  Declaring a service method to return CallbackHandle allows the developer to
  construct a unique JavaScript function to obtain results from a remote JSON
  service, and automatically convert the JSON object into a Java object, just
  like any other RPC method result.  Encoding parameters is left as an exercise
  to the reader. 


Example
-------

Define the service:

  import com.google.gwt.user.client.rpc.AsyncCallback;
  import com.google.gwtjsonrpc.client.RemoteJsonService;

  public interface StringService extends RemoteJsonService {
    public void append(String a, String b, AsyncCallback<String> ac);
  }

Configure GWTJSONRPC in Application.gwt.xml:

  <inherits name='com.google.gwtjsonrpc.GWTJSONRPC'/>
  <servlet path='/StringService'
           class='example.StringServiceImpl'/>

Implement the service in Java as a servlet:

  import com.google.gwt.user.client.rpc.AsyncCallback;
  import com.google.gwtjsonrpc.server.JsonServlet;

  public StringServiceImpl extends JsonServlet
    implements StringService
  {
    public void append(String a, String b, AsyncCallback<String> ac)
    {
      if (a != null && b != null)
        ac.onSuccess(a + b);
      else
        ac.onFailure(new IllegalArgumentException("Null input"));
    }
  }

Create the service in the browser:

  StringService cs = GWT.create(StringService.class);
  ((ServiceDefTarget) cs).setServiceEntryPoint(
    GWT.getModuleBaseURL() + "StringService");

or alternatively use the bind utility:

  StringService cs = GWT.create(StringService.class);
  JsonUtil.bind(cs, "StringService");

and finally invoke the service:

  cs.append("foo", "bar", new AsyncCallback<String>() {
    public void onSuccess(String result) {
      GWT.log("append = " + result, null);
    }
    public void onFailure(Throwable why) {
      GWT.log("append failure", why);
    }
  });
