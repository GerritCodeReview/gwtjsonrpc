/**
 * Declare an RPC call as caching its return value in the host page.
 *
 * <p>This is typically useful to allow the server to insert a JSON object into the host page as the
 * host page is sent to the client, permitting some of the initial RPCs required by the module's
 * <code>onModuleLoad()</code> function to complete immediately, without waiting for a round-trip to
 * the server.
 *
 * <p>By default <code>once = true</code>, causing the host page JSON object to be deleted from the
 * window during its first access. This allows subsequent RPC calls to round-trip to the server.
 *
 * <p>If the host page variable is not defined by the server the call degrades into a standard RPC.
 * In some applications this may make it easier to debug in hosted mode, where the static HTML is
 * loaded by default, rather than through a servlet which generates the hosted page on the fly.
