 * Annotation permitting a cross-site request without the XSRF token.

 * the server wants to export for general query use by any mash-up sort of application.
 *
 * <p><b>Methods tagged with this annotation should only be on publicly known data, e.g. data which
 * is more readily available through sources other than this based JSON service method.</b>
